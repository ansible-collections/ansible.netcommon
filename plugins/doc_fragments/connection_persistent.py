    - Reduce CPU usage and network module execution time
      by enabling direct execution. Instead of the module being packaged
      and executed by the shell, it will be directly executed by the Ansible
      control node using the same python interpreter as the Ansible process.
      Note- Incompatible with C(asynchronous mode).
      Note- Python 3 and Ansible 2.9.16 or greater required.
      Note- With Ansible 2.9.x fully qualified modules names are required in tasks.
