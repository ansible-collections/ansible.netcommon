        # Original hook implementation is flaky due to *several* bugs described
        # in https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/12364
        # a) CI=1 needed to avoid incomplete output
        # b) two executions are needed because --list-different works correctly
        # only when run with --check as with --write the output will also
        # include other entries and logging level cannot be used to keep only
        # modified files listed (any file is listed using the log level, regardless if
        # is modified or not).
        # c) We avoid letting pre-commit pass each filename in order to avoid
        # running multiple instances in parallel. This also ensures that running
        # prettier from the command line behaves identically with the pre-commit
        # one. No real performance downsides.
        # d) exit with the return code from list-different (0=none, 1=some)
        # rather than the write (0=successfully rewrote files). pre-commit.ci
