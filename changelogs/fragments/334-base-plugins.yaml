minor_changes:
  - Copied the cliconf, httpapi, netconf, and terminal base plugins and NetworkConnectionBase into netcommon.
    These base plugins may now be imported from netcommmon instead of ansible if a collection depends on
    netcommon versions newer than this version, allowing features and bugfixes to flow to those collections
    without upgrading ansible.
