bugfixes:
  - network_cli - Add ability to set options inherited from paramiko/libssh in ansible >= 2.11
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.netcommon/pull/271).
deprecated_features:
  - network_cli - The paramiko_ssh setting ``look_for_keys`` was set automatically based on the
    values of the ``password`` and ``private_key_file`` options passed to network_cli. This option
    can now be set explicitly, and the automatic setting of ``look_for_keys`` will be removed after
    2024-01-01  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.netcommon/pull/271).
