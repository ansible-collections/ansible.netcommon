minor_changes:
  - >-
    The ``net_put`` module uses temporary files created via the Python
    function ``mkstemp`` instead of the current working directory
bugfixes:
  - >-
    Reset SCP connections after `fetch_file` and `put_file` calls for `libssh`
    connections. This resolves the issue with Cisco SCP servers that close
    channels after SCP operations.
  - >-
    Improve handling of temporary files in `net_put` so failures no longer
    leave lingering temporary files in the current working directory.
