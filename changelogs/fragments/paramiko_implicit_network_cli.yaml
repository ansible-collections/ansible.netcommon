minor_changes:
  - network_cli - When ssh_type is set to paramiko, the connection plugin now uses
    an in-collection paramiko implementation instead of loading ansible-core's paramiko
    connection plugin. This allows network_cli to work with versions of ansible-core,
    where the paramiko connection plugin was removed.
  - network_cli - The in-collection paramiko path supports the same host key policy
    behavior (including host_key_auto_add and known_hosts handling) and persistent
    connection caching as the previous ansible-core paramiko integration.
deprecated_features:
  - network_cli - The in-collection paramiko support (used when ssh_type is paramiko)
    is a compatibility layer for environments where ansible-core's paramiko connection
    is no longer available. This layer is deprecated and will be removed in a release
    after 2028-02-01. Migrate to ssh_type=libssh by installing the
    ansible-pylibssh package.
